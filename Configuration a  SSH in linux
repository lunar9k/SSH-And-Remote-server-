#By default, the config file will not be present and the user needs to create it using the touch command

#Config File Syntax
#SSH config file takes the following syntax


Host [Alias1]
    Option1 [value]
    Option2 [value]
    Option3 [value]
    
Host [Alias2]
    Option1 [value]
    Option2 [value]
    
Host [Alias3]
    Option1 [value]

#SSH Client reads the configuration file stanza by stanza. If more than one pattern matches, then the options from the first matching stanza take precedence. Hence, the host-specific declaration should come first and the generic declaration should be kept last. 
#There is numerous number of ssh options available which can be found by typing man ssh_config in Linux terminal or can check in /etc/ssh/ssh_config file for reference.
